# Legal Case Management System - Technical and Functional Specification

## Overview
A FastAPI-based REST API service for managing legal cases, providing core functionality for a legal case management system.

## Technical Stack
- FastAPI framework for API development
- SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations
- Alembic for database migrations
- SQLite database for data storage
- JWT-based authentication
- CORS middleware for cross-origin requests

## Current Architecture
- Multi-layered architecture (API, Services, Models, Database)
- Role-based access control
- JWT token authentication
- Document management capabilities
- Case management functionality

## Proof of Concept (PoC) Simplification Strategy
To prove FastAPI's suitability as a backend service, the following simplifications are recommended:

1. Authentication Simplification
- Remove JWT authentication and OAuth2 implementation
- Remove password hashing and token generation
- Keep basic user identification through simple API keys or no authentication
- Benefits: Faster development cycles, easier testing, reduced complexity

2. Authorization Simplification
- Remove role-based access control
- Remove user permission checks
- Treat all users as having full access
- Benefits: Simplified API endpoints, clearer data flow, focused core functionality

3. Data Model Simplification
- Simplify user model (remove password hashing, roles)
- Reduce relationship complexity
- Keep core case and document models
- Benefits: Easier database management, simpler queries, faster development

## Core Functionality to Retain
- Case CRUD operations
- Document management
- Basic user operations
- API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)

## Development Focus
- API endpoint functionality
- Data model validation
- FastAPI feature demonstration
- Quick iteration capability

This PoC aims to demonstrate FastAPI's capabilities for building a scalable legal case management system while temporarily removing complex security and authorization features to speed up development and testing.
